# Friday Night Funkin' VR
## What the funk is this?
Friday Night Funkin' VR (FNFVR for short) is a fanmade VR port of Friday Night Funkin' (FNF), a rhythm game originally created for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck in a Loop".  
You can find the original FNF on [itch.io](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin), [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371), and [GitHub](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).  
  
FNFVR is an unofficial standalone VR version of FNF, built from the ground up in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).  
This is **NOT** a modification of FNF, but it will follow the same licenses as if it were one.  
Follow the [FNFVR Twitter](https://twitter.com/FunkinVR) for quick updates!
  
## What's it all about?
* **A fresh new take on the FNF formula!** Hit the notes with your hands with a layout reminiscent of games like Guitar Hero and face your opponent head-on... literally!  
* **New VR-exclusive mechanics!** Do things you could only dream of pulling off in 2D--like for example, dodging Pico's bullets in Blammed!  
* **Robust level creation system!** Easily create new levels of your own with the source, and if you wanna get real fancy, you can also create interruptable asynchronous events (mumbo jumbo for cool mechanics that can be paused or straight up deleted when exiting to the main menu).  
* **Adjustable step zone!** Don't like the placement of the lanes in front of you? Then move it yourself, *idiot!*  
* **And more now, and more to come!** The team is hard at work creating new stuff and making improvements to the stuff that's already there. In fact, this GitHub is open to bug reports and suggestions just for that purpose!
